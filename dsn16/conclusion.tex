\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented \projecttitle, a data provenance library for unmodified \pthreads-based shared-memory multithreaded programs. Our approach targets existing executables, relies on OS-specific mechanisms and new ISA extensions of \intelpt  to efficiently build the {\em Concurrent Provenance Graph (CPG)}. The CPG records control, data, and schedule dependencies for multithreaded executions. Our solution is completely transparent and straightforward to deploy: it simply replaces {\tt pthreads} library, allowing existing C/C++ applications to benefit from our approach with no re-compilation or code changes.  The source code of \projecttitle is publicly available.
