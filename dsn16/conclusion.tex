\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented \projecttitle, a data provenance library for multithreaded programs. Our approach targets existing executables, relies on OS-specific mechanisms and new ISA extensions of \intelpt  to efficiently build the {\em Concurrent Provenance Graph (CPG)}. The CPG records control, data, and schedule dependencies for the shared-memory multithreaded program execution. Our solution is completely transparent and straightforward to deploy: it simply replaces {\tt pthreads} library, allowing existing C/C++ applications to benefit from our approach with no re-compilation or code changes.  The source code of \projecttitle is publicly available for use in a wide-range of workflows for data provenance.
