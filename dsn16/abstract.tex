Data provenance strives for {\em explaining} how the computation was performed, by recording a ``trace" of the execution. In this paper, we present \projecttitle, a {\tt POSIX}-compliant data provenance library for shared-memory multithreaded programs. The \projecttitle library is completely transparent and easy to use: it can be used as a replacement for the \pthreads library by a simple exchange of libraries linked, without even recompiling the application code.  


To achieve this result,  we present a parallel provenance algorithm that records intra and inter-thread control and data dependencies using  a {\em Concurrent Provenance Graph} (CPG).  We implemented our algorithm to operate at the compiled binary code
level by leveraging a combination of OS-specific mechanisms, and recently released \intelpt ISA extensions.  Our
evaluation on a multicore platform using applications from multithreaded benchmarks suites (PARSEC
and Phoenix) shows reasonable overheads for recording data provenance. \projecttitle's source code is publicly available.
