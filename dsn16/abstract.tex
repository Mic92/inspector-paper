Data provenance strives for {\em explaining} how the computation was performed, by recording and presenting a ``trace" of the execution to the developers to aid debugging. 
In this paper, we present \projecttitle, a {\tt POSIX}-compliant data provenance library for shared-memory multithreaded programs. The \projecttitle library is completely transparent and easy to use: it can be used as a replacement for the \pthreads library by a simple exchange of libraries linked, without even recompiling the application code.  


To achieve this result,  we present a parallel provenance algorithm that records intra and inter-thread control and data dependencies using  a Concurrent Provenance Graph (CPG).  We implemented our algorithm to operate at the compiled binary code
level by leveraging operating system-specific mechanisms, and Intel's Processor Trace ISA extensions (\intelpt).  Our
evaluation on a multicore platform using applications from multithreaded benchmarks suites (PARSEC
and Phoenix) shows reasonable overheads for recording data provenance.
