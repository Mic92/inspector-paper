\section{Snapshot Mechanism}
\label{sec:snapshot}
An additional challenge that we need to address in the library implementation is the excessive log data produced by \intelpt, especially for long running applications. Therefore, we further extended the library to support a live snapshot facility, where the user can analyze the provenance on-the-fly while the program is still running. The library periodically takes a consistent snapshot~\cite{chandy-lamport} of the CPG in a decentralized fashion.
