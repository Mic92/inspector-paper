\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we presented \projecttitle, a data provenance library for multithreaded programs. Our approach targets existing executables, relies on OS-specific mechanisms and new ISA extensions of \intelpt  to efficiently build the {\em Concurrent Provenance Graph (CPG)}. The CPG records control, data, and schedule dependencies for the shared-memory multithreaded program execution. Our solution is straightforward to deploy: it simply replaces the {\tt pthreads} library, allowing existing applications to benefit from our approach with no re-compilation or code changes. \projecttitle's source code is publicly available for further use in a wide-range of workflows for data provenance.
